C was not created by Steve Jobs. C was created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.<br/> <br/>
Steve Jobs was a co-founder of Apple Inc. and played a significant role in the development of Apple's products, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and the iPhone. While Apple's products have been developed using a variety of programming languages, including C and C++, Steve Jobs was not directly involved in the creation of those languages.<br/> <br/>
However, Steve Jobs did recognize the importance of technology and software in the success of Apple, and he played a key role in driving the company's focus on user experience and design. He also had a strong influence on the development of the personal computer industry, and his vision helped to shape the way that we use technology today.<br/> <br/>
Objective-C was created by Brad Cox and Tom Love at their company Stepstone in the early 1980s. Cox and Love were developing software tools for building distributed systems, and they wanted a programming language that would allow for dynamic binding and message passing between objects.<br/> <br/>
  Objective-C was based on the existing C programming language, with added features for object-oriented programming. It quickly gained popularity in the NeXTSTEP development community, and was used extensively in the development of the NeXTSTEP operating system and the applications that ran on it.<br/> <br/>
In 1996, Apple acquired NeXT Computer, and with it, the rights to Objective-C.<br/><br/>
Steve Jobs co-founded the company NeXT Computer Inc. after leaving Apple in 1985, and NeXT was the company that developed the NeXTSTEP operating system, which was based on the Mach kernel and used Objective-C as its primary programming language.<br/><br/>
Steve Jobs was one of the co-founders of Apple Inc. in 1976 and played a major role in the development of the company and its products, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and later products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.<br/><br/>
  One of the most famous collaborations between Gates and Jobs was the development of software for the original Macintosh computer in the early 1980s. Microsoft developed several applications for the Macintosh, including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, which became some of the most popular software programs for the platform.
  <br/><br/>
  Steve Jobs was the CEO of NeXT Computer Inc. from its founding in 1985 until its acquisition by Apple Inc. in 1996. So, he was the owner of NeXT for a little over 10 years.
  <br/><br/>
After the acquisition of NeXT by Apple, Steve Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor, and eventually became the CEO of Apple in 1997. He played a key role in turning around Apple's fortunes and making it one of the most successful technology companies in the world.
  <br/>
  In the early days of Microsoft, the company primarily developed software for the Altair 8800, one of the first commercially successful personal computers. The programming language used for this software was primarily assembly language, which was a low-level language that allowed for direct control over the computer's hardware.

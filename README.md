Why did i choice c++.?
It runs on any device. Server Mobile Tabelt watch anything..
But if you see! about "C". I still tell the story.(PUBLIC)
About apple, microsoft and android. but for real. android also have alot c++ and that's also in apple to.
but the truth is just that there are different ways of adding files to it. And compile it.
And more trust way to do it.
I personally use Visual Studio "Code" Remember "Code".
There are many tools that are better than those built into Visual studio visual studio "community".
If you know there is something called Remote Explorer. it just one of them if you are tired of sharing files back and forth from your mac or pc.
There more than you know.
have you read the source code in the other files.
I can also figure out how to make comments in c


Well  need to get out..

in 2023 the market for tablet and mobile is it as just a note..

C was not created by Steve Jobs. C was created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.<br/> <br/>
Steve Jobs was a co-founder of Apple Inc. and played a significant role in the development of Apple's products, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and the iPhone. While Apple's products have been developed using a variety of programming languages, including C and C++, Steve Jobs was not directly involved in the creation of those languages.<br/> <br/>
However, Steve Jobs did recognize the importance of technology and software in the success of Apple, and he played a key role in driving the company's focus on user experience and design. He also had a strong influence on the development of the personal computer industry, and his vision helped to shape the way that we use technology today.<br/> <br/>
Objective-C was created by Brad Cox and Tom Love at their company Stepstone in the early 1980s. Cox and Love were developing software tools for building distributed systems, and they wanted a programming language that would allow for dynamic binding and message passing between objects.
<br/><br/>
Objective-C was based on the existing C programming language, with added features for object-oriented programming. It quickly gained popularity in the NeXTSTEP development community, and was used extensively in the development of the NeXTSTEP operating system and the applications that ran on it.<br/> <br/>
In 1996, Apple acquired NeXT Computer, and with it, the rights to Objective-C.<br/><br/>
Steve Jobs co-founded the company NeXT Computer Inc. after leaving Apple in 1985, and NeXT was the company that developed the NeXTSTEP operating system, which was based on the Mach kernel and used Objective-C as its primary programming language.<br/><br/>
Steve Jobs was one of the co-founders of Apple Inc. in 1976 and played a major role in the development of the company and its products, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and later products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.<br/><br/>
  One of the most famous collaborations between Gates and Jobs was the development of software for the original Macintosh computer in the early 1980s. Microsoft developed several applications for the Macintosh, including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, which became some of the most popular software programs for the platform.
  <br/><br/>
  Steve Jobs was the CEO of NeXT Computer Inc. from its founding in 1985 until its acquisition by Apple Inc. in 1996. So, he was the owner of NeXT for a little over 10 years.
  <br/><br/>
After the acquisition of NeXT by Apple, Steve Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor, and eventually became the CEO of Apple in 1997. He played a key role in turning around Apple's fortunes and making it one of the most successful technology companies in the world.
  <br/><br/>
  In the early days of Microsoft, the company primarily developed software for the Altair 8800, one of the first commercially successful personal computers. The programming language used for this software was primarily assembly language, which was a low-level language that allowed for direct control over the computer's hardware. <br/>  <br/>
  The Altair 8800 was designed and produced by the company MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems), which was founded by Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims in 1969. MITS was based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and initially focused on developing electronic calculators and other scientific instruments. <br/>  <br/>
They are so old that I couldn't find a png for them so I have saved their logo as mark.jpg üïµÔ∏è
Mr Bill gates "Micro" -Soft come on dude.!<br/>  <br/>
As Microsoft grew and began developing software for other platforms, such as the IBM PC, the company began using higher-level programming languages such as C, which allowed for faster development and easier maintenance of software. C++ was later introduced as an extension of the C programming language, and Microsoft began using it for developing more complex software products.<br/><br/>
  C++ is not owned or controlled by Microsoft, but Microsoft is one of the major contributors to the development and standardization of the language. Microsoft has been actively involved in the development of C++ for many years, and has developed many tools and libraries for working with C++.<br/><br/>

Microsoft uses C++ extensively in the development of its software products, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office, Visual Studio development environment, and many others. C++ is a powerful programming language that provides high performance and allows for efficient low-level memory management, making it well-suited for developing complex software applications.<br/><br/>

In addition to using C++ in its own software products, Microsoft has contributed to the development of C++ through its participation in the ISO C++ standardization process, and through the development of the Visual C++ compiler and related tools. Overall, while C++ is not owned by Microsoft, the company has played a significant role in the development and advancement of the language.<br/><br/>

The human auditory system is capable of detecting sound waves in the range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. The perception of sound is a continuous process and not divided into distinct frames like in video or images. Therefore, the concept of "frames per millisecond" is not applicable to sound perception.
<br/><br/>
However, the human auditory system is capable of distinguishing between sounds that differ by as little as 2-3 Hz in frequency, and can detect changes in loudness as small as 1 dB. This high level of sensitivity enables humans to perceive complex sounds such as music, speech, and environmental sounds with a high degree of accuracy and fidelity.

Dear team,

I wanted to clarify some ground rules for being part of this project. As the inventor and CEO of how-to-get-your-attention.com, I want to make sure that everyone involved understands their roles and responsibilities.

First, I want to remind everyone that the code you write for this project is owned by how-to-get-your-attention.com, with approval. As the owner, I reserve the right to take a fee of 3% for paying clients. However, I may choose to take a lower percentage in some products.

In addition to the programmer fee, we will be charging a services fee to cover the costs of hosting, maintenance, and customer support. The services fee will be 15% of the total amount paid by customers for our products, plus applicable taxes and company taxes in the countries where we operate.

We will share 5% of the profits from the project with the team each day.
Finally, I want to make it clear that we have a zero-tolerance policy for disputes and conflicts within the team. If any team member engages in behavior that is disruptive or harmful to the project, they will be immediately removed from the team.

First, I want to make it clear that we do not use open source or other free code.(Without the approval of pirasath luxchumykanthan) We pay annually for licenses from Microsoft, Apple, Android, and hosting services.
WEE BUILD!!!!

Thank you for your time and commitment to this project.

Best regards,
Pirasath Luxchumykanthan

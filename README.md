C was not created by Steve Jobs. C was created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.<br/> <br/>
Steve Jobs was a co-founder of Apple Inc. and played a significant role in the development of Apple's products, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and the iPhone. While Apple's products have been developed using a variety of programming languages, including C and C++, Steve Jobs was not directly involved in the creation of those languages.<br/> <br/>
However, Steve Jobs did recognize the importance of technology and software in the success of Apple, and he played a key role in driving the company's focus on user experience and design. He also had a strong influence on the development of the personal computer industry, and his vision helped to shape the way that we use technology today.<br/> <br/>
Objective-C was created by Brad Cox and Tom Love at their company Stepstone in the early 1980s. Cox and Love were developing software tools for building distributed systems, and they wanted a programming language that would allow for dynamic binding and message passing between objects.
<br/><br/>
Objective-C was based on the existing C programming language, with added features for object-oriented programming. It quickly gained popularity in the NeXTSTEP development community, and was used extensively in the development of the NeXTSTEP operating system and the applications that ran on it.<br/> <br/>
In 1996, Apple acquired NeXT Computer, and with it, the rights to Objective-C.<br/><br/>
Steve Jobs co-founded the company NeXT Computer Inc. after leaving Apple in 1985, and NeXT was the company that developed the NeXTSTEP operating system, which was based on the Mach kernel and used Objective-C as its primary programming language.<br/><br/>
Steve Jobs was one of the co-founders of Apple Inc. in 1976 and played a major role in the development of the company and its products, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and later products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.<br/><br/>
  One of the most famous collaborations between Gates and Jobs was the development of software for the original Macintosh computer in the early 1980s. Microsoft developed several applications for the Macintosh, including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, which became some of the most popular software programs for the platform.
  <br/><br/>
  Steve Jobs was the CEO of NeXT Computer Inc. from its founding in 1985 until its acquisition by Apple Inc. in 1996. So, he was the owner of NeXT for a little over 10 years.
  <br/><br/>
After the acquisition of NeXT by Apple, Steve Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor, and eventually became the CEO of Apple in 1997. He played a key role in turning around Apple's fortunes and making it one of the most successful technology companies in the world.
  <br/><br/>
  In the early days of Microsoft, the company primarily developed software for the Altair 8800, one of the first commercially successful personal computers. The programming language used for this software was primarily assembly language, which was a low-level language that allowed for direct control over the computer's hardware. <br/>  <br/>
  The Altair 8800 was designed and produced by the company MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems), which was founded by Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims in 1969. MITS was based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and initially focused on developing electronic calculators and other scientific instruments. <br/>  <br/>
They are so old that I couldn't find a png for them so I have saved their logo as mark.jpg 🕵️
Mr Bill gates "Micro" -Soft come on dude.!<br/>  <br/>
As Microsoft grew and began developing software for other platforms, such as the IBM PC, the company began using higher-level programming languages such as C, which allowed for faster development and easier maintenance of software. C++ was later introduced as an extension of the C programming language, and Microsoft began using it for developing more complex software products.<br/><br/>
  C++ is not owned or controlled by Microsoft, but Microsoft is one of the major contributors to the development and standardization of the language. Microsoft has been actively involved in the development of C++ for many years, and has developed many tools and libraries for working with C++.<br/><br/>

Microsoft uses C++ extensively in the development of its software products, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office, Visual Studio development environment, and many others. C++ is a powerful programming language that provides high performance and allows for efficient low-level memory management, making it well-suited for developing complex software applications.<br/><br/>

In addition to using C++ in its own software products, Microsoft has contributed to the development of C++ through its participation in the ISO C++ standardization process, and through the development of the Visual C++ compiler and related tools. Overall, while C++ is not owned by Microsoft, the company has played a significant role in the development and advancement of the language.<br/><br/>

Thanks to Android for a wide range of brands, including Alcatel, Acer, Amazon, Archos, ASUS, BlackBerry, Celkon, Coolpad, Elephone, Fujitsu, Google, HP, HTC, Huawei, iBall, Infinix, Intex, Karbonn, Lava, Lenovo, LG, Micromax, Meizu, Motorola, Oppo, Panasonic, Philips, Razer, Realme, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Swipe, TCL, Tecno, Toshiba, Vivo, Wiko, Xiaomi, Yota Devices, ZTE, and many more.

The similarities between Android Q gestures and iOS gestures are undeniable. The concept of swiping up from the bottom of the screen to go home or access recent apps is a distinctive feature of Apple's iOS interface.

Copying ideas in the tech industry is not uncommon, and it has happened in both directions between Apple and Google. Steve Jobs himself acknowledged that great ideas are often borrowed or "stolen" to create something new and better.

While the basic idea of a bottom bar gesture is shared, Android's implementation is not identical to iOS. Android has its own distinct commands and features, such as contextual app suggestions and a universal search bar. Additionally, Android's edge-of-screen back gestures are specific to the Android platform.

On the other hand, Apple has also borrowed concepts from Android. For example, having a card-based info feed one swipe to the right from the home screen (Today View) was inspired by Google's Google Now/Google Feed. Apple also adopted the swipe-down gesture to access and manage notifications, a feature that originated in Android.

The back-and-forth borrowing of ideas is a common occurrence in tech evolution. Good ideas tend to spread across platforms, leading to the development of standards and benefiting users of various devices.

It's worth noting that sometimes, directly copying concepts may not work well in a different environment. For example, emulating Apple's App Shortcuts on Android may not be the most sensible approach. Similarly, Android's attempt to replicate iOS-like gestures for opening the Overview interface may feel awkward and inconsistent.

Ultimately, feeling indignant about companies copying each other's ideas misses the point. Apple and Google are corporations, and consumers are the ones who benefit from their continuous efforts to improve products.

In the end, this evolution and idea borrowing lead to progress and better products for all users. Regardless of platform preference, consumers ultimately win by getting improved gadgets, even if it involves some degree of copying along the way.

<h2 align="center"><strong>Unveiling the Power Within: Decoding the Essence of Auditory Perception</strong></h2>
<!--Programmers let's get together-->
<!--
A document have have many layers.
-->
<p align="center">
The human auditory system is capable of detecting sound waves in the range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. The perception of sound is a continuous process and not divided into distinct frames like in video or images. Therefore, the concept of "frames per millisecond" is not applicable to sound perception.
<br/><br/>
However, the human auditory system is capable of distinguishing between sounds that differ by as little as 2-3 Hz in frequency, and can detect changes in loudness as small as 1 dB. This high level of sensitivity enables humans to perceive complex sounds such as music, speech, and environmental sounds with a high degree of accuracy and fidelity.

<h1>IPA and APK: A Common File Format</h1>
The IPA (iOS App Store Package) and APK (Android Application Package) file formats, although designed for different mobile platforms, share a common underlying structure. Both IPA and APK files utilize the ZIP file format for compression, organization, and distribution of their respective application contents.
The ZIP file format, originally introduced by Phil Katz in the late 1980s, provides a standardized approach for compressing files and directories into a single archive. Over time, it has undergone updates and extensions to support new features, improved compression methods, and enhanced compatibility.
The file signatures of IPA and APK files reveal their adherence to the ZIP format. Both IPA and APK files begin with the byte sequence 50 4B 03 04 (or 0x50, 0x4B, 0x03, 0x04 in hexadecimal representation), which corresponds to the ASCII characters "PK\x03\x04". This file signature indicates that the files follow the ZIP file format specifications.

Within the ZIP archive of an IPA or APK file, you can find various components of the respective applications. This includes the executable binary, resources, assets, configuration files, and other elements required for the application's functionality.

While the primary purpose of the ZIP format is to compress and package the application contents, additional elements specific to each platform are present. For example, APK files include resources and code specific to Android, whereas IPA files contain resources and code for iOS.

The zlib library, an open-source library developed by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler, underlies the compression and decompression functionality of the ZIP format used in both Android and iOS. This library has been widely adopted and integrated into various software systems, including the Android platform.

In conclusion, the IPA and APK file formats leverage the ZIP file format to compress, organize, and distribute their application contents. Despite their platform differences, both formats share a common foundation, facilitating efficient packaging and distribution of mobile applications for iOS and Android respectively.

<h1>Understanding File Formats: Executable Files and DMG Files</h1>
When working with different file formats, understanding their structures and characteristics can provide valuable insights. Let's explore the first bytes of two common file formats: executable files (".exe") and DMG (Disk Image) files.
<h2>Executable Files (".exe")</h2>
Executable files play a fundamental role in running applications on various operating systems. For Windows executables, the first two bytes hold significance. They are typically "MZ" (0x4D, 0x5A) in the ASCII representation. These two bytes are commonly referred to as the "Magic Number." They indicate that the file follows the Portable Executable (PE) file format used by Windows. The PE format includes headers, sections, and other data structures essential for proper execution.
It's important to note that other operating systems may have different file format standards for their executable files, and the first bytes may vary accordingly. The specific file format and structure determine how the operating system recognizes and interprets the executable file.

<h2>DMG (Disk Image) Files</h2>
DMG (Disk Image) files are often associated with macOS and serve as containers for file systems, applications, or entire disk volumes. The first byte in a DMG file can vary based on the specific DMG format used.
In the case of Apple Disk Images (DMG) commonly used on macOS, the first byte is typically "78" (0x78) in hexadecimal representation. This value indicates that the file is compressed using the zlib compression algorithm. However, it's important to note that DMG files can have different formats and variations, and the first byte may vary depending on the specific DMG format being used.

The contents of DMG files can include file systems, application files, metadata, and more. These files often require mounting or extracting to access their contents properly.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Understanding the first bytes of executable files and DMG files provides insights into their respective file formats and structures. While the first bytes help identify the file format, it's essential to consider the overall structure, headers, and other elements within the file to fully comprehend its functionality.
Exploring file formats broadens our knowledge of how different systems handle and interpret files. By understanding these nuances, we can better work with, analyze, and appreciate the rich diversity of file formats in the digital world.

Why I Like C++

C++ is a powerful programming language that offers several features that I find appealing. Here are some reasons why I enjoy working with C++:

1. Macros: C++ provides the ability to define macros, which allow for code expansion and customization. Macros can be used to define objects, functions, and other constructs, providing flexibility and reducing code duplication.

2. Android Development: C++ can be used in Android development through the Native Development Kit (NDK). While there may be some performance overhead or a need to interact with Java (and now Kotlin), the ability to use C++ opens up opportunities for efficient and low-level programming on the Android platform.

3. Kotlin's Rise: I believe that Kotlin is gradually replacing Java in the Android ecosystem. Kotlin is a modern and concise programming language that offers enhanced features and interoperability with existing Java codebases. Its popularity continues to grow, and it provides an alternative to Java for Android development.

4. Unified View on Mobile Platforms: Both iOS and Android platforms follow a similar approach where most functionality needs to be implemented within the application itself. This provides a consistent development experience across mobile platforms, making it easier to transition between the two.

5. Control on Servers: When working on server-side applications, C++ offers full control and flexibility. Its performance characteristics, low-level programming capabilities, and rich ecosystem of libraries make it well-suited for server development.

6. C++ on macOS: While macOS is gradually transitioning to Swift as a safer programming language, C++ still holds its ground. C++ allows developers to build efficient and high-performance applications on macOS, especially in areas that require low-level access or extensive use of existing C++ libraries.

In addition to the above, I particularly appreciate working with bytes, functions, and the multitude of options available in C++. This allows for fine-grained control over operations and enables optimization in various scenarios.

Why not build a cloud application that can work with Android, macOS, iOS, and Windows?

WinMain and wWinMain in Windows Applications
In a Windows application, the entry point function is typically either WinMain or wWinMain, depending on the string encoding requirements of the application.

WinMain
The WinMain function has the following signature:

c++
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow);
It serves as the entry point for ANSI-encoded strings, using the system's default code page. This is suitable for applications that don't need to work extensively with Unicode.

wWinMain
On the other hand, if you need to work with UTF-16 encoded strings (wide-character strings), you can use the wWinMain function as the entry point. It has the following signature:

int WINAPI wWinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPWSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow);
The wWinMain function accepts wide-character strings (UTF-16) for command-line arguments, allowing for better handling of Unicode text and filenames in this "Windows application".
Choose the appropriate entry point (WinMain or wWinMain) based on the string encoding requirements of your/this application. 
Wee use wWinMain provides the necessary support to start op the background services in windows server.

<h2>01-06-2023 18:23 Danish time Pirasath Luxchumykanthan</h2>

```Win32/Win32.cpp
#ifndef UNICODE
#define UNICODE
#endif
// Run on windows
#include <windows.h>
// Entry point for the Win32 Application
int WINAPI wWinMain(_In_ HINSTANCE hInstance, _In_opt_ HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, _In_ LPWSTR lpCmdLine, _In_ int nCmdShow)
{
    if (lpCmdLine == NULL)
    {
        // Code to handle service-specific logic
        // This block will execute when the code is running as a service
        return 0;
    }
    // Code to handle non-service logic
    // This block will execute when the code is running as a regular application
    return 0;
}
```
 I will demonstrate how to utilize an application as a Windows service, showcasing the ability to distinguish between service-specific and non-service execution. The provided code snippet will serve as an example to illustrate this differentiation.

Entry Point for the Win32 Application:
The wWinMain function serves as the entry point for the Win32 application. It accepts several parameters, including the instance handle, previous instance handle, command line, and window display options.

Differentiating Service-Specific and Non-Service Execution:
Within the wWinMain function, we can utilize the lpCmdLine parameter to determine whether the application is running as a service or a regular application. This parameter represents the command line passed to the application during execution.

If lpCmdLine is NULL, it indicates that the application is running as a service. In this case, we can add code within the corresponding block to handle service-specific logic. This logic can include initialization, setting up service-specific functionality, and any other tasks required by the service.

On the other hand, if lpCmdLine is not NULL, it implies that the application is running as a regular application. The code within the corresponding block can handle non-service logic, such as user interactions, graphical interfaces, or other functionalities specific to regular application execution.

Conclusion:
By examining the lpCmdLine parameter within the wWinMain function, we can distinguish between service-specific and non-service execution. This allows us to implement different code paths based on the application's context.

I've created Win32/Developer.h.
```Win32/Developer.h
 Developer& dev = Developer::getInstance();
            dev.Messages("hallo world");
            //Win32/Developer.txt
```
So, why did I create this file? As a developer, I believe in the importance of logging and tracking the actions and changes made during the development process. While console messages can be useful for real-time debugging, they often get lost or overwritten. By having a dedicated log file, I can easily look back and review the entire development journey, spot any errors, and analyze the actions taken.

Using a log file allows me to maintain a comprehensive record of my work, ensuring that the source code is fine-tuned and functions at its best. It's an essential practice to achieve a 100% working solution.

Additionally, once I'm done testing and have deployed the application to a server, I'll remove the logging function from the release version. This step is crucial to optimize resource usage, as logging unnecessary information in a server environment can consume RAM and disk space without providing any meaningful benefits.

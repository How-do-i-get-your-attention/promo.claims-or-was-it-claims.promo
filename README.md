C was not created by Steve Jobs. C was created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.<br/> <br/>
Steve Jobs was a co-founder of Apple Inc. and played a significant role in the development of Apple's products, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and the iPhone. While Apple's products have been developed using a variety of programming languages, including C and C++, Steve Jobs was not directly involved in the creation of those languages.<br/> <br/>
However, Steve Jobs did recognize the importance of technology and software in the success of Apple, and he played a key role in driving the company's focus on user experience and design. He also had a strong influence on the development of the personal computer industry, and his vision helped to shape the way that we use technology today.
